> A modern, plugin-based API for sending mails in Drupal 8. Inspired by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mail)

## Why?
- No 'modern' way to handle mails in Drupal 8: messing with `hook_mail` and `hook_theme` does not really fit in the Wieni Drupal flow with [wmmodel](https://github.com/wieni/wmmodel), [wmcontroller](https://github.com/wieni/wmcontroller), etc.
- No clean, object-oriented API, e.g. to add CC / BCC-adresses you have to manually add headers
- Not intuitive, logic is scattered across multiple files, tends to get messy

## Installation

This package requires PHP 7.1 and Drupal 8 or higher. It can be
installed using Composer:

```bash
 composer require wieni/wmmailable
```

## How does it work?

### Building mails
- Mails are annotated plugins
- Each class represents one mail
- Dependency injection is possible by implementing the `ContainerFactoryPluginInterface` ([tutorial](https://chromatichq.com/blog/dependency-injection-drupal-8-plugins))

```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\wmcustom\Mail;

/**
 * @Mailable(
 *     id = "contact_form_submission",
*      template = "mail.contact-submission"
 * )
 */
class ContactFormSubmission extends MailableBase
{
    public function build(array $parameters): MailableInterface;
}
```

- It is possible to take over other module's mails at the time of sending. To do this, change the `id` and `module` properties. The original mail parameters will be passed to the `build` method. Example:
```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\wmcustom\Mail;

/**
 * @Mailable(
 *     id = "register_no_approval_required",
 *     module = "user",
 *     template = "mail.account-confirmation"
 * )
 */
class AccountConfirmationMail extends MailableBase
{
    public function build(array $parameters): MailableInterface
    {
        $parameters['oneTimeLoginUrl'] = user_pass_reset_url($parameters['account']);
        
        {...}
    }
}
```

### Theming mails
- Mail templates should be stored in a theme. This theme can be set in the 
 `theme` value of the `wmmailable.settings` config, with the default theme 
 as a fallback.

- The location of the template within the theme is also configurable:
    - the default location is in the `mail` subfolder, with the id with 
     dashes instead of underscores as template name.
    - a custom location can be set in the annotation, in the form of a 
     path relative to the theme, with filename but without extension. 
     Dots can be used as directory seperator.

- The mail formatter determines how mails are rendered. Thanks to the 
 [mailsystem](https://www.drupal.org/project/mailsystem) module, we can 
 change the mail formatter separately from the mail sender. This module 
 provides 3 formatters. The formatters as listed here are incremental: 
 they all contain the features listed in the previous formatters.
    - _Mailable - Plain_: the most basic mail formatter. Depending on the 
     passed `Content-Type` header, this formatter will output HTML or plain 
     text mails.
    - _Mailable - With inline styles_: allows you to attach 
     [asset libraries](https://www.drupal.org/node/2274843) to mails by 
     passing them to `MailableInterface::addLibrary` or an array of asset 
     libraries to `MailableInterface::setLibraries`.
    - _Mailable - Foundation for Emails_: allows you to compose mails using 
     the [Inky](https://get.foundation/emails.html) templating language. 
     To use this formatter, you need to have the 
     [`thampe/inky`](https://github.com/thampe/inky) package installed. 

### Sending mails
- Mails are sent through the `Mailer` service
- Two standard `Mailer` implementations are provided: `mailable.mailer.direct` and `mailable.mailer.queued`
- The active implementation can be changed in the `mailable.settings.yml` config

```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\wmcustom\Form;

use Drupal\wmmailable\Mailer\MailerInterface;

class ContactForm extends FormBase
{
    /** @var MailerInterface */
    protected $mailer;

    public function __construct(
        MailerInterface $mailer
    ) {
        $this->mailer = $mailer;
    }

    public function submitForm(array &$form, FormStateInterface $formState)
    {
        $mail = $this->mailer->create('contact_form_submission')
            ->setRecepients(['Wieni <info@wieni.be>', 'dieter@wieni.be'])
            ->addBcc('sophie@wieni.be')
            ->setParameters(
                compact('domain', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'email', 'question')
            );
        
        $this->mailer->send($mail);
	}

	public static function create(ContainerInterface $container)
	{
	    return new static(
	        $container->get('mailable.mailer')
        );
    }
}
```

### Logging sent mails
- When enabled, this wil log all outgoing mails - also those that aren't composed through this module.
- To enable, configure the [mailsystem](https://www.drupal.org/project/mailsystem) module to use _Mailable - Logger_ as 
 the mail sender.
- To view logged mails, go to `/admin/reports/sent-mails` or follow the menu link at _Reports_ > _Sent mails_.

### Hooks and events
- Two hooks are provided, `hook_mailable_alter` and `hook_mailable_{module}_{key}_alter`. These hooks are called after the `send` method is called on the mailable, but before the mail is sent.

```php
<?php

function wmcustom_mailable_alter(MailableInterface $mail)
{
    $mail->setHeader('X-SES-SOURCE-ARN', '<...>');
}
```

- Two events are provided, equivalent to the hooks:

```php
<?php

use Drupal\wmmailable\Event\MailableAlterEvent;
use Drupal\wmmailable\WmmailableEvents;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

class MailableAlterSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        $events[WmmailableEvents::MAILABLE_ALTER][] = 'onMailAlter';

        return $events;
    }

    public function onMailAlter(MailableAlterEvent $event)
    {
        $mailable = $event->getMailable();
        $mailable->setSubject("Here's a better subject.");
    }
}
```
